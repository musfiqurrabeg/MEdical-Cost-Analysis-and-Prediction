## 🧩 Project Overview

Medical bills aren’t just numbers — they’re stories of people, pain, prevention, and sometimes… surprise.

This project uses machine learning to **predict individual medical charges** based on real factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region.

But beyond the algorithm, this is about **understanding the invisible forces** that drive costs in healthcare systems.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project provides information about health insurance beneficiaries and their medical costs. It includes the following columns:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| age | age of primary beneficiary |
|bmi | body mass index |
|children | number of children covered by health insurance |
|smoker | smoking |
|region | the beneficiary's residential area in the US |
|charges | individual medical costs billed by health insurance |

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the medical costs for individuals based on their attributes. By analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns and relationships, the model will provide insights into the factors influencing medical expenses.

## Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The dataset will be prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, will be explored and evaluated to determine the most effective model for cost prediction.

## Impact
Accurate medical cost prediction has significant implications for various stakeholders, including insurance companies, healthcare providers, and individuals. A reliable predictive model can assist insurance companies in assessing risks, determining appropriate premium rates, and managing resources efficiently. Healthcare providers can benefit from cost estimation to optimize resource allocation and budget planning. Additionally, individuals can gain insights into their potential medical expenses and make informed decisions regarding health insurance coverage.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into medical cost prediction and contribute to more accurate financial planning in the healthcare industry.
